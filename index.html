  <p>Thank you for choosing this application. To avoid any copyright issues, we will be keeping additional audio streaming channels out of the application. The list of streaming channels will be updated regularly. If you are facing issues with any of the links, please share the feedback through contact available in Google PlayStore.</p>
  <p>Radio Player can stream any audio related links or urls (direct audio links or m3u8 links). Concept and base source is taken from BitRate Application available in Play Store. Some of the streaming channels are added by default, and cannot be deleted. Playback is powered by Exoplayer</p>
